## Severity Breakdown

### üö® High Severity (3/9) - 33%
**Business Impact**: Financial loss, data corruption, trust erosion  
**Examples**: Reentrancy, ID overlap, double-spending  
**Priority**: **Immediate** - Resolve before any deployment consideration

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Medium Severity (2/9) - 22%
**Business Impact**: Logic violations, emergency failures  
**Examples**: Donation limits, refund exclusion  
**Priority**: **High** - Resolve before mainnet testing

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Low Severity (3/9) - 33%
**Business Impact**: UX issues, minor inefficiencies  
**Examples**: Events, precision, access control  
**Priority**: **Medium** - Resolve during optimization phase

### üìù Informational (1/9) - 11%
**Business Impact**: Best practices, maintainability  
**Examples**: Data filtering improvements  
**Priority**: **Low** - Address during refactoring

## Risk Assessment
