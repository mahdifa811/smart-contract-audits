## 🎯 Key Findings

### 🚨 High Severity (1) - Immediate Action Required
- **Reentrancy in `executeTransaction`**: Allows a malicious contract to drain funds by re-entering the function before the `executed` flag is set.

### ⚠️ Medium Severity (1) - Significant Issue
- **Bypassing Transaction Time Delay in `revokeTransaction`**: Revoking a confirmation can reset the time delay, allowing immediate transaction execution.

### ℹ️ Low & Informational (3)
- **Gas Optimization with Mapping**: Using a mapping instead of an array for transactions can reduce gas costs.
- **Missing Zero Address Check in `_owners`**: Constructor lacks validation for zero addresses in the owners array.
- **Redundant `transactionTime` Check**: Unnecessary check for negative `transactionTime` in constructor.

## 🏗️ Project Overview

### Project Information
`MultiSig.sol` is a multi-signature wallet contract designed to manage transactions requiring multiple owner confirmations with a time delay mechanism. It supports proposing, confirming, revoking, and executing transactions, as well as receiving ETH deposits. As a learning project, it provides valuable insights into secure wallet design, with identified issues serving as educational opportunities.

## 📋 Quick Reference
### Critical Fixes Priority
- **Finding 1 (High)**: Add `nonReentrant` modifier or update `executed` state before external calls in `executeTransaction`.
- **Finding 2 (Medium)**: Modify `revokeTransaction` to reset `timeStarted` only if confirmations fall below `required`.
- **Finding 3 (Low)**: Replace `transactions` array with a mapping and use a counter for `txId`.
